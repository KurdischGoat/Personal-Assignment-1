# Personal-Assignment-VR



## Project Overview



This is the first personal assignment where I demonstrate my unity VR project showing off locomotion, scene composition, interaction and sockets, plus some extra features.



## Features



- Beautiful scene (not really) with houses, trees, flowers, rocks, chairs, tables and a beautiful view on mountains and clouds
- Locomotion with a bounded teleportation area and smooth locomotion with an analog stick
- 5 realtime lights and one baked light throughout the scene 
- Tree garden where each tree has a unique PBR texture (the ugly trees in the corner) 
- Interaction with a lot of different object: rocks, chairs, sacks, the shiny big tree, yellow flowers
- Different sockets for interaction: table, bench, small crate, medium crates
- Spatial audio with 3D attenuation
- Height Map on the big shiny tree i think
- Simple Shader Graph effect on the weird pile of rocks
- Visual feedback for interaction state with the rock right at spawn (It's red now)


## Setup instructions



Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/KurdischGoat/Personal-Assignment-1.git

```



# Known issues

- The teleportation area is just a square so you can escape the place at the corners of the map

- The PBR textures, self made shader and height map are bad

- The bags look ugly when you put them on the crate and bench sockets

- If you grab an object and go forward with it, it goes extremely far away from you and if you go backwards it goes extremely near to you
